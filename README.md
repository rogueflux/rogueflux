# Priyanshu Sil | Embedded Systems & SoC Verification Engineer

### About Me
Hello! I am an enthusiast and aspiring professional in the fields of Embedded Systems and System-on-Chip (SoC) Designing currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication at the Manipal Institute of Technology. My journey into electronics started with curiosity about how everyday devices function seamlessly from smartphones to smart home gadgets. Over the years, this curiosity has evolved into a passion for building intelligent systems where hardware and software converge. I explored making digital systems, ranging from UVM-based verification environments for RISC-V processors to deploying TinyML models for maritime defense for DRDO applications. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to innovations that make electronic systems smarter, faster, and more energy-efficient, bridging creativity and engineering excellence.
