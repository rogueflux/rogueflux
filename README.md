# 🛠️ Priyanshu Sil | Embedded Systems & SoC Verification Engineer

### 👨‍💻 About Me
[cite_start] I am an aspiring SoC Verification and Embedded Systems Engineer currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication at the Manipal Institute of Technology [cite: 105, 108]. [cite_start] I specialize in creating robust digital systems, ranging from UVM-based verification environments for RISC-V processors to deploying TinyML models for maritime defense [cite: 12, 56, 91]. [cite_start] With a background that includes leading hardware projects for DRDO applications and interning in industrial power infrastructure at Tata Power, I focus on building hardware that is both high-performance and mission-critical [cite: 14, 46, 85]. [cite_start] I am driven by the challenge of optimizing signal integrity in PCB design and ensuring design rigor through constrained random verification [cite: 15, 39, 84].
