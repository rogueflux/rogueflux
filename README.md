# Priyanshu Sil | Embedded Systems & SoC Verification Engineer

### About Me
I am an aspiring Embedded Systems and SoC Verification Engineer currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication at the Manipal Institute of Technology. I specialize in creating robust digital systems, ranging from UVM-based verification environments for RISC-V processors to deploying TinyML models for maritime defense. With a background that includes leading hardware projects for DRDO applications and interning in industrial power infrastructure at Tata Power, I focus on building hardware that is both high-performance and mission-critical. I am driven by the challenge of optimizing signal integrity in PCB design and ensuring design rigor through constrained random verification.
